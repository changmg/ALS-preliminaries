Last Update: 2009-03-11
======================================================================


These Instructions are intended to help you with the installation of 
the tools needed to successfully run the labs, and with the installation 
of the lab database itself.

CONTENTS
================================

1. Software installation
2. Lab database installation
3. Lab database configuration and testing


**********************************************************************
1. Software installation
======================================================================

This workshop needs the following tool(s) to be installed:



To download the required software release, you have to access
the Solvnet Release Library:

1. Navigate your browser to http://solvnet.synopsys.com

2. Log in using your solvnet id and password
   If you are not registered, follow the directions on this 
   page to sign up for solvnet

3. Select "Documentation & Downloads Center" on the main navigation,
   followed by "Release Library"

4. Use the drop-down menus to select the correct software

5. Follow the instructions to download and install the software on 
   your workstation



**********************************************************************
2. Lab database Installation
======================================================================

Execute the following command to unpack the archive:

        unix$  gtar xzf ces_ref.tar.gz

Note:  Archives were created using GNU tar.


Multiple account installation:
Since the lab directory structure may contain symbolic links that 
should be preserved instead of being expanded, it is strongly 
recommended that you untar the file directly into each account.
Repeat the following for every user account:

unix$ cd /path/to/user/account1
unix$ gtar xzf /path/to/ces_ref.tar.gz


**********************************************************************
3. Lab database configuration and testing
======================================================================


Configuration
==============================

The "setup.csh" file is provided for your convenience.
Please modify it appropriately to match your local environment. 
source the modified setup.csh file prior to testing and 
running the labs.


Testing
==============================

To verify that the lab files are complete, and test for the correct
versions of the software, it is recommended that you run the supplied
test script (the current directory has to be the "ref" directory):


        unix$  ./.testscript


This will run a series of tests to verify that all files exist, and that
the tools can be invoked.

If everything is ok, you should see output similar to:

------------------------------------------------------------

Note:
By default, the GUI test is skipped.
To include the GUI test, edit the file ".testscript" and change
the variable $test_gui to "1" at the top of the file. 
Rerun the test after that.
Make sure that you have the DISPLAY environment variable set
correctly, otherwise the test will fail.
