<dt><b>NAME</b>
       </dt><dd>espresso - input file format for espresso(1OCTTOOLS)</dd><dd>
<p>
</p></dd><dt><b>DESCRIPTION</b>
</dt><dd>
       Espresso  accepts  as  input  a two-level description of a
       Boolean function.  This is described as a character matrix
       with keywords embedded in the input to specify the size of
       the matrix and the logical format of the  input  function.
       Programs  exist  to translate a set of equations into this
       format (e.g., eqntott(1OCTTOOLS), bdsyn(1OCTTOOLS), eqnto-
       pla(1OCTTOOLS)).   This  manual page refers to Version 2.3
       of Espresso.
<p>
       Comments are allowed within the input by placing  a  pound
       sign  (#)  as the first character on a line.  Comments and
       unrecognized keywords are passed directly from  the  input
       file  to  standard output.  Any white-space (blanks, tabs,
       etc.), except when used as a delimiter in an embedded com-
       mand, is ignored.  It is generally assumed that the PLA is
       specified such that each row of the PLA fits on  a  single
       line in the input file.
</p><p>
</p></dd><dt><b>KEYWORDS</b></dt><dt>
</dt><dd>
       The  following  keywords  are recognized by espresso.  The
       list shows the probable order of the  keywords  in  a  PLA
       description.  [d] denotes a decimal number and [s] denotes
       a text string.  The minimum required set of keywords is .i
       and  .o  for binary-valued functions, or .mv for multiple-
       valued functions.
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt> .i [d]</dt><dd>      Specifies the number of input variables.

</dd><dt>       .o [d]</dt><dd>      Specifies the number of output functions.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       .mv [num_var] [num_binary_var] [d1] . . . [dn]
                  </dt><dd> Specifies the number of  variables  (num_var),
                   the     number     of     binary     variables
                   (num_binary_var), and the size of each of  the
                   multiple-valued variables (d1 through dn).
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       .ilb [s1] [s2] . . . [sn]
                   </dt><dd>Gives  the  names  of  the binary valued vari-
                   ables.  This must come after  .i  and  .o  (or
                   after .mv).  There must be as many tokens fol-
                   lowing the keyword as there  are  input  vari-
                   ables.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       .ob [s1] [s2] . . . [sn]
                   </dt><dd>Gives the names of the output functions.  This
                   must come after .i  and  .o  (or  after  .mv).
                   There  must  be  as  many tokens following the
                   keyword as there are output variables.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       .label var=[d] [s1] [s2] ...
                   </dt><dd>Specifies the names of the parts of  a  multi-
                   ple-valued  variable.   This  must  come after
                   .mv.  There must be as many  tokens  following
                   the  keyword as there are parts for this vari-
                   able.  Note that the  variables  are  numbered
                   starting from 0.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       .type [s]   Sets the logical interpretation of the charac-
                   </dt><dd>ter matrix as described below  under  "Logical
                   Description of a PLA".  This keyword must come
                   before any product terms.  [s] is one of f, r,
                   fd, fr, dr, or fdr.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       .phase [s]  [s] is a string of as many 0's or 1's as there
                   </dt><dd>are  output  functions.   It  specifies  which
                   polarity  of  each  output  function should be
                   used for the minimization (a 1 specifies  that
                   the  ON-set  of the corresponding output func-
                   tion should be used, and a  0  specifies  that
                   the  OFF-set of the corresponding output func-
                   tion should be minimized).
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       .pair [d]   Specifies the number  of  pairs  of  variables
                   </dt><dd>which  will  be  paired together using two-bit
                   decoders.  The rest of the line contains pairs
                   of  numbers which specify the binary variables
                   of the PLA which will be paired together.  The
                   binary variables are numbered starting with 0.
                   The PLA will be reshaped so that any  unpaired
                   binary  variables  occupy the leftmost part of
                   the array,  then  the  paired  multiple-valued
                   columns, and finally any multiple-valued vari-
                   ables.  If  the  labels  have  been  specified
                   using  .ilb,  then  the  variable names may be
                   used instead of the column number.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       .symbolic [s0] [s1] . . . [sn] ; [t0] [t1]  . . . [tm] ;
                   </dt><dd>Specifies  that  the  binary-valued  variables
                   named [s0] thru [sn] are to be considered as a
                   single  multiple-valued  variable.    Variable
                   [s0]  is  considered the most significant bit,
                   [s1] the next most significant,  and  [sn]  is
                   the  least  significant  bit.   This creates a
                   variable with 2**n parts corresponding to  the
                   decodes  of  the binary-valued variables.  The
                   keywords [t0] thru [tm] provide the labels for
                   each  decode  of [s0] thru [sn].  ([t0] corre-
                   sponds to a value  of  00...00,  [t1]  is  the
                   value  00...01,  etc.).   The binary-variables
                   may be identified  by  column  number,  or  by
                   variable  name when .ilb is used.  The binary-
                   variables are removed from the function  after
                   the multiple-valued variable is created.

                   [sn] are to be considered as a single symbolic
                   output.  This creates 2**n more  output  vari-
                   ables  corresponding to the possible values of
                   the outputs.  The outputs may be identified by
                   number  (starting from 0), or by variable name
                   when .ob is used.   The  outputs  are  removed
                   from the function after the new set of outputs
                   is created.

</p></dd><dt><b>LOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF A PLA</b></dt><dt>
</dt><dd>
       When we speak of the ON-set of a Boolean function, we mean
       those  minterms  which  imply  the  function value is a 1.
       Likewise, the OFF-set are  those  terms  which  imply  the
       function is a 0, and the DC-set (don't care set) are those
       terms for which the function is unspecified.   A  function
       is  completely  described by providing its ON-set, OFF-set
       and DC-set.  Note that all minterms lie in  the  union  of
       the  ON-set, OFF-set and DC-set, and that the ON-set, OFF-
       set and DC-set share no minterms.
<p>
       The purpose of the espresso  minimization  program  is  to
       find a logically equivalent set of product-terms to repre-
       sent the ON-set and optionally minterms which lie  in  the
       DC-set, without containing any minterms of the OFF-set.
</p><p>
       A  Boolean function can be described in one of the follow-
       ing ways:
</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt>       1)    </dt><dd> By providing the ON-set.  In  this  case,  espresso
              computes  the  OFF-set as the complement of the ON-
              set and the DC-set is  empty.   This  is  indicated
              with the keyword .type f in the input file.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       2)     </dt><dd>By  providing the ON-set and DC-set.  In this case,
              espresso computes the OFF-set as the complement  of
              the  union  of  the  ON-set and the DC-set.  If any
              minterm belongs to both the ON-set and DC-set, then
              it  is  considered  a don't care and may be removed
              from the ON-set during  the  minimization  process.
              This  is indicated with the keyword .type fd in the
              input file.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       3)    </dt><dd> By providing the ON-set and OFF-set.  In this case,
              espresso  computes  the DC-set as the complement of
              the union of the ON-set and the OFF-set.  It is  an
              error  for any minterm to belong to both the ON-set
              and OFF-set.  This error may not be detected during
              the  minimization,  but  it can be checked with the
              subprogram "-Dcheck" which will check  the  consis-
              tency  of  a  function.  This is indicated with the
              keyword .type fr in the input file.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>       4)     </dt><dd>By providing the ON-set, OFF-set and DC-set.   This
              is  indicated  with  the  keyword  .type fdr in the
              input file.
<p>
</p></dd></dl>
       If at all possible, espresso should be  given  the  DC-set
       (either  implicitly or explicitly) in order to improve the
       results of the minimization.
<p>
       A term is represented by a "cube" which can be  considered
       either  a  compact  representation of an algebraic product
       term which implies the function value is a 1, or as a rep-
       resentation  of  a row in a PLA which implements the term.
       A cube has an input part which corresponds  to  the  input
       plane  of  a  PLA, and an output part which corresponds to
       the output plane of a PLA (for the  multiple-valued  case,
       see below).
</p><p>

</p></dd><dt><b>SYMBOLS IN THE PLA MATRIX AND THEIR INTERPRETATION</b></dt><dt>
</dt><dd>
       Each  position  in the input plane corresponds to an input
       variable where a 0 implies the corresponding input literal
       appears  complemented in the product term, a 1 implies the
       input literal appears uncomplemented in the product  term,
       and  -  implies  the  input literal does not appear in the
       product term.
<p>
       With type f, for each output, a 1 means this product  term
       belongs  to  the  ON-set,  and a 0 or - means this product
       term has no meaning for the value of this function.   This
       type corresponds to an actual PLA where only the ON-set is
       actually implemented.
</p><p>
       With type fd (the default), for each  output,  a  1  means
       this  product  term  belongs to the ON-set, a 0 means this
       product term has no meaning for the value  of  this  func-
       tion, and a - implies this product term belongs to the DC-
       set.
</p><p>
       With type fr, for each output, a 1 means this product term
       belongs to the ON-set, a 0 means this product term belongs
       to the OFF-set, and a - means this  product  term  has  no
       meaning for the value of this function.
</p><p>
       With  type  fdr,  for  each output, a 1 means this product
       term belongs to the ON-set, a 0 means  this  product  term
       belongs  to  the  OFF-set,  a  -  means  this product term
       belongs to the DC-set, and a ~ implies this  product  term
       has no meaning for the value of this function.
</p><p>
       Note  that  regardless of the type of PLA, a ~ implies the
       product term has no meaning for the value  of  this  func-
       tion.   2  is allowed as a synonym for -, 4 is allowed for
       1,  and 3 is allowed for ~.
</p><p>

</p></dd><dt><b>MULTIPLE-VALUED FUNCTIONS</b></dt><dt>
</dt><dd>
       Espresso will also minimize multiple-valued Boolean  func-
       tions.   There  can  be  an  arbitrary number of multiple-
       valued variables, and each can be of a different size.  If
       there  are  also  binary-valued  variables, they should be
       given as the first variables on  the  line  (for  ease  of
       description).   Of  course, it is always possible to place
       them anywhere on the line as a two-valued  multiple-valued
       variable.   The function size is described by the embedded
       option .mv rather than .i and .o.
<p>
       A multiple-output binary function with ni  inputs  and  no
       outputs  would be specified as .mv ni+1 ni no.  .mv cannot
       be used with either .i or .o - use one  or  the  other  to
       specify the function size.
</p><p>
       The  binary  variables are given as described above.  Each
       of the multiple-valued variables are given as a bit-vector
       of  0  and  1 which have their usual meaning for multiple-
       valued functions.  The last multiple-valued variable (also
       called  the  output) is interpreted as described above for
       the output (to split the function into an ON-set,  OFF-set
       and DC-set).  A vertical bar | may be used to separate the
       multiple-valued fields in the input file.
</p><p>
       If the size of the  multiple-valued  field  is  less  than
       zero,  than a symbolic field is interpreted from the input
       file.  The absolute value of the size specifies the  maxi-
       mum number of unique symbolic labels which are expected in
       this column.  The symbolic labels are  white-space  delim-
       ited strings of characters.
</p><p>
       To  perform  a  kiss-style  encoding  problem, the keyword
       .kiss should be included in the file.  The third  to  last
       variable  on  the input file must be the symbolic "present
       state", and the second to last variable must be the  "next
       state".   As always, the last variable is the output.  The
       symbolic "next state" will be hacked to be  actually  part
       of the output.
</p><p>
</p></dd><dt><b>EXAMPLE #1</b></dt><dt>
</dt><dd>
       A two-bit adder which takes in two 2-bit operands and pro-
       duces a  3-bit  result  can  be  described  completely  in
       minterms as:
<p>
</p><pre>                 # 2-bit by 2-bit binary adder (with no carry input)
                 .i 4

                 1110  101
                 1111  110
</pre>
<p>
       It  is  also  possible to specify some extra options, such
       as:
</p><p>
</p><pre>                 # 2-bit by 2-bit binary adder (with no carry input)
                 .i 4
                 .o 3
              .ilb a1 a0 b1 b0
              .ob s2 s1 s0
                 .pair 2 (a1 b1) (a0 b0)
                 .phase 011
                 0000  000
                 0001  001

                 1111  110
              .e
</pre>
<p>
       The option .pair indicates that  the  first  binary-valued
       variable  should  be  paired  with the third binary-valued
       variable, and that the second variable  should  be  paired
       with  the  fourth  variable.   The  function  will then be
       mapped into  an  equivalent  multiple-valued  minimization
       problem.
</p><p>
       The option .phase indicates that the positive-phase should
       be used for the second and third  outputs,  and  that  the
       negative phase should be used for the first output.

       This example shows  a  description  of  a  multiple-valued
       function  setup  for kiss-style minimization.  There are 5
       binary variables, 2 symbolic variables (the  present-state
       and the next-state of the FSM) and the output (8 variables
       total).
